## Challenge-1
### Challenge One dealt with a company by the name of Horiseon. They wanted their web page to be more accesible and I did that by changing some things up in their .html file and cleaning up their CSS file
<b/>
### In the .html file I gave the website a consice and descriptive title of "Horeison: Media Management". I added alt attributes to the images in the website so they can be readily accesible, the heading is in sequential order when viewed and all links take you to correct part of the website when clicked. As far as the code goes, I got rid of unecessary repetition, especially in the .css file. Grouped many classes together so that the code was shorter and easier to read and grouped each element together so they would not be scattered, again, to make the code easier to read.
